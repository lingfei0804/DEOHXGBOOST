Dataset and code for 'A Differential Evolution Optimized Hybrid XGBoost for Accurate Carbon Emission Prediction'.

The dataset are from energyinst.org

The source of the code is written either in the '.txt' or '.py' file.

The operation of differential evolution requires the prediction results of other models.

The code has been updated.
